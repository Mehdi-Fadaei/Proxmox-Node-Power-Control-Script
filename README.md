# Proxmox-Node-Power-Control-Script
This repository contains a simple Bash script to control multiple Proxmox nodes remotely. It supports Wake-on-LAN (WOL) to power on nodes and SSH shutdown to power them off.  Perfect for a small Proxmox homelab where you want to start and stop nodes easily from one main node.
